# OTUnitTest
Unit test support for OpenTRV code on microcontrollers.

Initially for V0p2 on AVR (ATMega328P).

Should be largely hardware independent and able to run safely on
vanilla Arduino UNO (including emulated)
or on (almost) any V0p2 hardware.

This library should not itself be dependent on any other V0p2 code.
